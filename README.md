# DSA Solutions Repository

Welcome to the **DSA Solutions** repository! This repository contains my personal solutions and approaches to a wide range of data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems. The problems span multiple categories, including arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and more. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and provide a reference for others learning DSA.
